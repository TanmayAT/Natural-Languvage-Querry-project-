## Natural Language Query Agent with Conversational Intelligence

This repository contains the code for a Natural Language Query Agent built to answer user questions over reference text and a table of model architectures. It utilizes open-source libraries and pre-trained models to provide conversational and informative responses.

**Project Goals:**

* Demonstrate the ability to work with data and research techniques for natural language processing.
* Develop a Natural Language Query Agent capable of answering simple questions about provided lecture notes and LLM architectures.
* Showcase an intermediary representation for organizing and storing the data efficiently.

**Features:**

* Answers user queries related to lecture notes and LLM architectures.
* Leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for generating conversational responses.
* Uses vector indexing for efficient information retrieval.
* (Optional) Implements conversational memory for contextually aware follow-up questions.
* (Optional) Provides citations for information used in the answer.
* (Optional) Generates summaries of conversation sessions.

**Data Sources:**

* Stanford LLMs Lecture Notes (select 3-4 lectures)
* Table of LLM Architectures ([https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM#milestone-papers](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM#milestone-papers))

**Technical Stack:**

* Python 3.x
* Libraries (may vary based on implementation):
    * langchain (or similar) for data processing and vector indexing
    * faiss or llama-index for vector indexing
    * Pre-trained LLM API (e.g., Bard, Jurassic-1 Jumbo) for answer synthesis
    * Additional libraries for data manipulation and text processing (e.g., pandas, nltk)

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) Download and configure the pre-trained LLM API you plan to use (refer to their documentation).
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Demo:**

The code is designed for demonstration purposes. To showcase its functionality, you can interact with the agent through the script or potentially develop a simple user interface. Ask the agent questions related to the lecture notes or LLM architectures, and it will attempt to provide informative and conversational responses.

**Deployment:**

A production deployment would require additional considerations like:

* Scaling the system for larger datasets and user loads.
* Implementing a robust user interface (web app, chatbot) for user interaction.

**Further Development:**

This is a basic implementation to showcase core functionalities. Potential areas for further exploration include:

* Implementing more advanced NLP techniques for complex question handling.
* Expanding the knowledge base with additional data sources.
* Integrating with a graphical user interface for a more interactive experience.
* Implementing a robust deployment system for scalability.
